My academic trajectory has always been related to International Relations and Political Science, both teaching and researching. Quantitative methods have been as well a constant investment in my academic formation. My main fields of expertise are foreign policy analysis and legislative studies, with an empirical emphasis in Latin American countries. I am interested in understanding legislative behavior, political parties, Executive-Legislative relations, changes in foreign policy, decision making process in foreign policy, evaluation of foreign policy, bureaucratic politics and media and foreign policy. I am coordinator of the [Foreign Policy in Numbers](https://sites.usp.br/pen/en/home-english/) project, a data repository on Brazil’s activities abroad, quantifying Brazilian foreign policy in serveral relevant dimensions.
