Abstract

his article assesses whether, after the hiatus of  Temer and Bolsonaro, Lula  continued  to  pursue  an  overstretched  foreign  policy  in  his  third  term.  We  conclude  that  although  he  has  restrained  from  those  impulses,  this  is  less  due  to  any learning from past mistakes and primarily because of  the pressures of  the new geopolitical order. To make these points, we leverage data and analytical techniques to measure the overstretch along the lines of  the project Foreign Policy in Numbers, hosted at the International Relations Institute of  the São Paulo University.
Keywords: Brazilian foreign policy; foreign policy overstretch; presidential diplomacy.
